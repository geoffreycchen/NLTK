    "#### nps_chat corpus is a corpus of instant messaging chat sessions.The corpus contains over 10,000 posts, anonymized by replacing usernames with generic names of the form \"UserNNN\", and manually edited to remove any other identifying information. The corpus is organized into 15 files, where each file contains several hundred posts collected on a given date, for an age-specific chatroom (teens, 20s, 30s, 40s, plus a generic adults chatroom). The filename contains the date, chatroom, and number of posts; e.g., 10-19-20s_706posts.xml contains 706 posts gathered from the 20s chat room on 10/19/2006."

Adjectives describe nouns, and can be used as modifiers (e.g. large in the large pizza), or in predicates (e.g. the pizza is large). English adjectives can have internal structure (e.g. fall+ing in the falling stocks). Adverbs modify verbs to specify the time, manner, place or direction of the event described by the verb (e.g. quickly in the stocks fell quickly). Adverbs may also modify adjectives (e.g. really in Mary's teacher was really nice). English has several categories of closed class words in addition to prepositions, such as articles (also often called determiners) (e.g., the, a), modals (e.g., should, may), and personal pronouns (e.g., she, they). Each dictionary and grammar classifies these words differently."

For example, it will assign the tag JJ to any occurrence of the word frequent, since frequent is used as an adjective (e.g. a frequent word) more often than it is used as a verb (e.g. I frequent this cafe). A unigram tagger behaves just like a lookup tagger (4), except there is a more convenient technique for setting it up, called training. In the following code sample, we train a unigram tagger, use it to tag a sentence, then evaluate:"
